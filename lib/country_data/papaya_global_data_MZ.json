          "maternity_leave": "In Mozambique, female employees are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave, which can start up to 20 days before the due date. The benefits are paid through Mozambique’s social security system. Employees receive 100% of their average daily earnings if they have made at least 12 months of contributions in the 18 months before the expected due date. While the law allows for 90 days of maternity leave, the social security system only pays for 60 days. The 90-day leave applies in cases of full-term or premature delivery, regardless of whether it was a live or stillborn birth."

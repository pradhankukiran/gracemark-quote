When using fixed term contracts, justified dismissal can also be by non renewal of the contract at the end date, termination as specified in the contract’s terms, conversion of the contract to an indefinite term or expiration of the work permit (for expatriate employees).\nWhere the dismissal reason given is found to be illegitimate, the employee will be entitled to additional compensation: if the contract is for a fixed term, the employee will be entitled to his wages for the remaining period of his contract. If the contract was for an indefinite term, the employee will be entitled to 15 days wages for each year of service.  in both cases the minimum compensation may not be less than two months’ wages.\nIt is also possible to end employment via a Mutual Termination Agreement providing there is written consent from the employee.\nIt is not permitted to terminate workers whilst they are on maternity or medical leave.",
          "notice_period": "In Saudi Arabia, the notice period is dependent on the type of contract in place.\nFor termination or resignation of an indefinite term contract (open-ended and paid monthly), 60 days’ notice is required. For other workers, 30 days notice is required.",

For fractions of a year, the employee is entitled to proportionate EOSB. EOSB is calculated on the basis of the employee’s last salary.\nIf the employee resigns, they are entitled to 1/3 of the award after service of no less than 2 consecutive years and not more than 5 years of service. 2/3 if their service is in excess of 5 successive years, but less than 10 years; and to the full award if their service amounts to 10 or more years.\nIf an employee is called to military service or cannot work because of force majeure, they are entitled to EOSB. Female employees are entitled to EOSB if they resign within 6 months of marriage or within 3 months of childbirth."

        "visa": {
          "general_info": "For an employee to acquire a work visa in Saudi Arabia, a third-party national must be sponsored by an employer. The employer must be registered with the Ministry of Interior and a file is opened with all the information on the employer’s foreign employees. Saudi Arabia’s quota system and nationalization program can make the process of employing a foreign national relatively complex and restrictive. Applicable procedures involve a home-country consular process followed by several post-arrival steps before final residency rights are granted.\n\nBusiness travelers typically apply for a Business Visit Visa at a Saudi consular post once they receive a government-approved letter of invitation from a sponsor in Saudi Arabia. Business Visit Visas are usually valid for three months (single entry) or 12 months (multiple entry), or up to five years (multiple entry) for citizens of countries that signed bilateral visa agreements with Saudi Arabia. The maximum allowable duration of stay under a single-entry visa for three and six months is 30 days; for visas with other validities it is 90 days.\n\nThere is no longer a short-term work option in Saudi Arabia. For long-term work, foreign nationals can apply for a Work Permit and Resident ID Card, which is valid for up to one year with the possibility of extensions.\nThis does not apply to citizens from Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman. Citizens from these countries may enter with their ID.\n\nThere is a new short-term work visa for certain foreign nationals, available via an online platform, Qiwa. This new visa enables qualified employees to work in Saudi Arabia for a visa-sponsoring entity for up to 90 days per visa issuance in one year. During the course of the one-year period (i.e. from the date of first entry into KSA), it will be possible to reapply for new temporary work visas at the end of each 90-day period. To apply, employers will need to be classified as at least “medium-green” in the Saudisation scheme, comply with obligations in the Wage Protection System, and ensure that foreign workers have valid work authorization.\n\nThe quota will be limited to 50 visas per employer and visas will not be transferrable to other entities. It is expected that many employers will take advantage of the new temporary work visa, as businesses in the KSA have been seeking a legally compliant solution for short-term work assignments.\n\nMore foreign national-friendly programs are expected in Saudi Arabia in the future as additional foreign labor will be needed to fill positions in the NEOM – a cross-border city in northwest Saudi Arabia that is planned to be built by 2025."

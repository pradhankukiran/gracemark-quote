Employees can carry these three days over to the following year, but this can only happen once, and the maximum sick leave is 6 days.\nThe California Family Rights Act (CFRA) provides enhanced rights to the FMLA. These laws provide women with unpaid and paid, job-protected time off from work for pregnancy and time after pregnancy, birth, adoption, and foster care.\nFor employers with 5 or more employees, the Pregnancy Disability Leave entitles employees who have disabilities related to pregnancy or the child’s birth up to four months of unpaid maternity leave.\nFor employers with 20 or more employees, the Family Leave law entitles employees with up to 12 weeks of family leave (applicable to women and men to bond with their children)\nFor employees eligible for California’s State Disability Insurance (SDI), employees with short-term disability are entitled to partial pay during their leave due to a temporary disability caused by pregnancy or childbirth (up to 6 weeks leave).\nThe Paid Family Leave Act entitles eligible employees to receive partial pay while taking time off work to bond with a newborn baby, newly adopted child, or foster child within the first 12 months of the child’s birth.\nDuring maternity leave, employees can use any accrued time, including vacation or sick leave.\nIn California, there are three laws regarding Paternity Leave:\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and The New Parent Leave Act (applies to employers with 20 – 49 employees) all three entitle new fathers to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.",

          "notice_period": "In Georgia, most employees are employed “at-will,” and either party can terminate the employment relationship without notice.\nIn Georgia, payout of unused vacation time is not required by law. However, employers will generally pay an employee for unused vacation days, provided the employee gave some advanced notice of resignation.\nWhile there is no official notice period, general practice is 2 weeks.\nIn mass dismissal cases the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) must be followed, and employers must give 60 days’ notice to impacted employees.",

          "general_info": "Foreign nationals without permanent resident status or a work visa are not permitted to work in the United States.\n\nAn employer seeking to hire a foreign national may file a petition with the United States Department of Homeland Security/United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an employment visa on behalf of the prospective employee.\n\nIf the petition is approved, the prospective employee must obtain a “visa stamp” from a United States embassy or consulate (Canadian citizens are exempt from this requirement).\n\nTo get a temporary U.S. work visa, an employer must file a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). An approved petition must be part of the visa request. The types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States.\n\nThe employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

The types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States.

If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore.

          "notice_period": "In Louisiana, most employees are employed “at-will,” and either party can terminate the employment relationship without notice.\nAn employer’s policy or employee contract governs whether earned or unused vacation is paid on separation.\nIn mass dismissal cases the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) must be followed, and employers must give 60 days’ notice to impacted employees.",
          "severance_pay": "Except as otherwise provided in an employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, employers need not make severance payments to terminated employees. Employers who choose to offer severance would need to have the provisions within the employee’s contract and agreed by both parties, many employers choose to offer severance payment linked to the employee’s length of service.",
          "probation_period": "No legal provision governs a formal “trial/probation period.” However, it is common practice for employers to set a performance evaluation after an initially stated period of employment of 90 days."

          "general_info": "Foreign nationals without permanent resident status or a work visa are not permitted to work in the United States.\n\nAn employer seeking to hire a foreign national may file a petition with the United States Department of Homeland Security/United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an employment visa on behalf of the prospective employee.\n\nIf the petition is approved, the prospective employee must obtain a “visa stamp” from a United States embassy or consulate (Canadian citizens are exempt from this requirement).\n\nTo get a temporary U.S. work visa, an employer must file a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). An approved petition must be part of the visa request. The types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in U.S. companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States. The employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

          "notice_period": "In Maine, most employees are employed “at-will,” and either party can terminate the employment relationship without notice.\nPrivate employers who have 11 or more employees are required to pay employees for any unused annual leave.\nStill, in general practice, two weeks’ notice is a minimum requirement.\nIn mass dismissal cases the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) must be followed, and employers must give 60 days’ notice to impacted employees.",

An approved petition must be part of the visa request. The types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States. The employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

An approved petition must be part of the visa request; the types of visas include:\n\n \n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States. The employer must have been unable to recruit a US worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

An approved petition must be part of the visa request; the types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore.

It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States. The employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

In such cases, the parties negotiate the foundations for a “just cause” termination case-by-case.",
          "notice_period": "In Michigan, most employees are employed “at-will,” and either party can terminate the employment relationship without notice.\nAn employer’s policy or employee contract governs whether earned or unused vacation is paid on separation.\nStill, in general practice, two weeks’ notice is a minimum requirement. In mass dismissal cases the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) must be followed, and employers must give 60 days’ notice to impacted employees.",

To get a temporary U.S. work visa, an employer must file a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nAn approved petition must be part of the visa request; the types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment)\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States. The employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements."

The types of visas include:\n\nH-1B – for applicants with a college degree hired to do specialized work. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended for an additional three years. The visa is connected to the employer that filed the petition. If there is a change of employer, the new employer must repeat the process. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year.\nH-1B1 – for applicants with a college degree from Chile and Singapore. The US government grants up to 1,400 visas to Chilean citizens and 5,400 from Singapore each year.\nH-2A – for temporary or seasonal agriculture work. It is limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nH-2B – for temporary non-agricultural work. These visas are limited to citizens of qualified countries. Usually valid for up to 1 year and can be extended to a maximum of 3 years.\nL – for intercompany transfers (people transferred from a foreign company to a US branch of the company.) The applicant must have been employed at the company for a year before the transfer and work in a managerial level position or higher with specialized knowledge.\n0 – for people with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n\nThe standard procedure is to obtain a short-term work visa and then apply for an immigrant visa after the employee has started working in the United States.\n\nFor those seeking employment-based immigrant visas:\n\nE-1 – highest priority employment for those with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, and athletics.\nE-2 – for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability.\nE-3 – for skilled workers and professionals, as well as unskilled workers.\nE-4 – members of certain immigrant groups.\nE-5 – immigrant investors in US companies (substantial investment).\n\nAlternatively, an employer may sponsor a potential employee’s application for permanent resident status, referred to as a “green card,” if the employee can establish that the potential employee is a multinational executive/manager transferee, has unique skills, or has been offered a job in the United States.\n\nThe employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

The employer must have been unable to recruit a U.S. worker who meets the position’s minimum requirements.\n\nAll employers are obligated to verify that all individuals they employ are authorized to work in the United States."

          "maternity_leave": "Maternity leave falls under the FMLA (see sick leave) which allows a mother:\nTwelve working weeks of leave in any one year for a child’s birth and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth.\nIn addition to the FMLA, Rhode Island’s Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) requires employers with four or more employees to provide reasonable accommodation to employees with conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, including modified work environments, longer breaks, light duty, job restructuring, modification of equipment (including seating), etc.\nLastly, Rhode Island Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) entitles employees who are temporarily unable to work due to pregnancy or childbirth to receive a portion of their regular salary pay up to 30 weeks, with an additional four weeks paid leave for new parents. This is part of the Rhode Island Temporary Caregiver Insurance.",

          "other_leave": "Leave for the care of an employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a severe health condition falls under the FMLA (see sick leave).\nAlternatively, an employee may take 26 working weeks of leave during a single one-year period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness.\nThe service member must be the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).\nOther leave under Rhode Island law includes:\nJob-protected but unpaid leave for full-time employees for jury duty or as a witness in a case, responding to a subpoena, or acting as a plaintiff or defendant in the courts. Employees must provide a copy of the jury summons to the employer as evidence of requirement.\nRhode Island has a state-run program that provides temporary disability insurance (TDI) for employees, paid for by a special tax withheld from employees’ pay. Rhode Island was the first state to provide a TDI program for employees. Eligible employees who are unable to work due to illness, injury, or pregnancy can get a cash benefit to partially replace their lost wages. The TDI program is operated by the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Some states have a program for SDI, or short-term disability insurance, but Rhode Island’s program is called TDI."
